## What this project does

Modern LLM-based MT is fluent but defaults to a neutral register. For literary and scriptural texts, register *is* meaning. This project compares three ways of adapting an open-source LLM to preserve Shoghi Effendi’s register on a low-resource, mixed-language corpus — under matched conditions, on the same base model and the same data.

The three adaptation strategies:

| Strategy | Mechanism | Updates weights? |
|---|---|---|
| **PEFT (LoRA)** | Supervised fine-tuning of LoRA adapters on parallel data | Yes (adapters only) |
| **AFSP** | Adaptive Few-Shot Prompting; retrieval of stylistically relevant exemplars into the prompt at inference time | No |
| **RLSF (PPO)** | Reinforcement learning from a mixed reward combining COMET, BLEU, and an LLM-as-Judge style score | Yes (from PEFT init) |

Plus a fourth condition — the **unadapted base model** — as reference.

All four are evaluated on the same held-out test set with COMET, BLEU, objective stylometric features, and LLM-as-Judge scoring.

---

## Research questions

- **RQ1.** How do PEFT, AFSP, and RLSF compare on semantic adequacy, stylistic fidelity, and compute/data cost under matched conditions?
- **RQ2.** Do retrieval-based exemplars (AFSP) and reward-driven updates (RLSF) shift outputs toward the target register relative to PEFT, measurably via stylometrics *and* judge scores?
- **RQ3.** How sensitive is RLSF to the reward weights (ω₁, ω₂, ω₃) on COMET / BLEU / style?
- **RQ4.** When applied to the same outputs, where do COMET, stylometric features, and LLM-as-Judge agree and disagree?

Full hypotheses (H1–H4) and support criteria are in [`docs/methodology.md`](docs/methodology.md). The project does **not** pre-commit to a ranking of the three adaptation methods.

## Data

- **Source:** Bahá’í scriptures originally in Persian and mixed Persian/Arabic, paired with Shoghi Effendi’s authorized English translations.
- **Granularity:** sentence-level for core experiments; paragraph-level as an optional extension.
- **Mixed-language handling:** source segments containing both Persian and Arabic are kept as single segments; the model is responsible for within-segment language mixing, mirroring how the authorized translations were produced.
- **No synthetic data** in training. Synthetic pairs from an unadapted LLM would dilute the target register signal, and validating their quality is out of scope.

### Splits

- Approximately **80 / 10 / 10** train / dev / test (85 / 5 / 10 acceptable if corpus size requires).
- **Split by document/section**, not by random row, to reduce stylistic leakage.
- The split is **fixed at the start** and frozen. File hashes are stored under `data/splits/`.
- Train: parameter updates only. Dev: all hyperparameter selection. Test: final evaluation only — unseen during RLSF and not used for any tuning.

### Preprocessing

Unicode NFC, diacritic handling, whitespace and punctuation normalization, removal of editorial metadata, deduplication on (src, tgt). No corpus-level tokenization — delegated to the base model’s tokenizer.

---

## Systems

### Base model
**`Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct`** — an open-source multilingual decoder-only Transformer in the 7B–8B range with documented Persian and Arabic coverage. It is **locked** and frozen across all four conditions so differences are attributable to adaptation, not model identity. Selection was vetted by a tokenizer-fertility check over the Arabic/Persian-script source: **2.70 subword tokens/word**, well clear of the catastrophic byte-fallback zone (see `docs/DEVLOG.md`, 2026-06-12).

### Reference (unadapted)
Base model, minimal style instruction (see `prompts/style_instruction.txt`), no exemplars, no fine-tuning. Provides the lower bound and the H1 comparison anchor.

### PEFT (LoRA)
LoRA adapters on the query and value projection layers of each attention block, base weights frozen. Trained with token-level MLE on the training partition. Rank, LR, and step count tuned on dev. QLoRA is the memory-pressure fallback. The resulting checkpoint also serves as the **RLSF initialization**.

### kNN few-shot (baseline) and AFSP (retrieval-based ICL)
No parameter updates. At inference time:

1. Embed the source segment with a multilingual sentence-transformer.
2. Retrieve top-k stylistically relevant exemplars by nearest neighbour over an index built over the **English (target-side)** training partition.
3. Insert them into a fixed prompt template (system role + style instruction + k exemplars + new source).

**`knn_fewshot` is the baseline:** plain top-k cosine retrieval with the above template — a baseline row, not the contribution. It is what `src/retrieval/` currently implements. **AFSP** is the adaptive variant built on top of the same index — margin-based scoring (hub penalisation), target-distribution-priority selection, demonstration ordering, and multi-view word-level weighting (see [`docs/afsp_strategies.md`](docs/afsp_strategies.md)). Reporting both isolates how much of any register shift comes from naive retrieval vs. the adaptive machinery.

Shot-count sensitivity on dev over **k ∈ {2, 4, 8}**, subject to base model context limits. Final k is fixed on dev before test inference. Pattern: Tang et al. [AFSP, 2025]; related precedents in Wang et al. style-activation prompting and style-matching exemplar selection.

### RLSF (PPO)
- **Init:** PEFT checkpoint.
- **Reference policy:** frozen copy of the PEFT checkpoint, used for KL regularization.
- **Reward:**
  ```
  r(y) = ω₁ · COMET(x, y, y*) + ω₂ · BLEU(y, y*) + ω₃ · Φ(y, S_T)
  ```
  with `Φ` an LLM-as-Judge style score using the **training-time** judge template. Weights are dev-tuned over a small grid that intentionally varies ω₃ relative to (ω₁, ω₂).
- **Bounded:** PPO step cap, batch cap, and judge API spend cap declared in `docs/budget.md` before training starts.
- **Fallback:** if PPO does not converge under budget, RLSF is reported using **best-of-N reranking** of PEFT-checkpoint samples, scored with the same reward.

## Evaluation

All four conditions, same held-out test set, same decoding settings (temperature, top-p, max-new-tokens fixed and logged before inference).

| Axis | Metric | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stylistic fidelity (primary) | LLM-as-Judge Φ | **Evaluation-time** template, separate from training-time template |
| Semantic adequacy | COMET (`wmt22-comet-da`) | per-segment, paired bootstrap CI 95% |
| Lexical overlap | BLEU (`sacrebleu`) | corpus-level |
| Stylometrics | Lexical density, TTR, avg sentence length + variance, register-marker counts | per-segment; aggregated per condition |
| Stylometric distance | Distance vs. reference on standardized feature vector | per-condition |
| Cost | Trainable params, inference latency, RLSF API calls + spend | reported per condition |

### Judge circularity mitigation
- Two separate, fixed judge templates: training-time (for RLSF reward) vs. evaluation-time (for final scoring). Templates are frozen before their respective phases and never tuned against the test set.
- Test partition is unseen during RLSF.
- Where budget permits, a **cross-family** confirmation pass with a judge from a different commercial LLM family is performed; judge–judge agreement is reported.

### Statistics
- System-level comparisons: paired bootstrap at the segment level, α = 0.05. Primary: each adaptation vs. Reference. Secondary: pairwise among the three adaptation conditions.
- Evaluation-component agreement (RQ4): pairwise Spearman correlation between COMET, stylometric distance, and LLM-as-Judge, with 95 % bootstrap CIs. Descriptive only.

### Results table *(filled as conditions complete)*

| Condition | COMET | BLEU | LLM-Judge Φ | Lex. density | TTR | Stylo. dist. | Latency (s/seg) | Trainable params |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reference | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | 0 |
| kNN few-shot (baseline, k = —) | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | 0 |

## Reproducibility

- Fixed random seeds at every stochastic stage (split, PEFT training, AFSP tie-breaking, PPO rollouts, judge sampling).
- Pinned library versions (`transformers`, `peft`, `trl`, `unbabel-comet`, `sacrebleu`, `sentence-transformers`, `faiss`).
- Logged per run: base model + revision, all prompts (system, user, judge × 2), decoding params, LoRA config, PPO config, reward weight grid and selected point, file hashes for splits and test outputs.

---

## Constraints

- **Compute:** Colab for training. LoRA default; QLoRA fallback.
- **API budget:** RLSF judge calls are the dominant cost. Hard cap declared in `docs/budget.md`; if approached, switch to best-of-N reranking.
- **Scope:** the project does not claim to fully capture literary or sacred style. It documents trade-offs across three adaptation families on one specific corpus and language combination not previously addressed in published LLM-MT work.
